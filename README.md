A Firefox extension to open or toggle a pinned tab with WhatsApp Web within it. This extension also adds a shortcut, and a button toggle within the toolbar.

## Usage

1. Toggle the pinned tab by pressing _`Alt+Shift+W`_. This shortcut can be changed by going to _`Add-ons` â†’ `WhatsApp Pinned` â†’ `Options`_.
2. If you prefer buttons over shortcuts, there is a toolbar button you can press to toggle the pinned tab.
