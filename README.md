## Introduction

A Firefox extension to open or toggle a pinned tab with WhatsApp Web within it. This extension also adds a shortcut, and a button toggle within the toolbar.

## How to Use

1. Toggle the pinned tab by pressing _`Alt+Shift+W`_. This shortcut can be changed by going to _`Add-ons` → `Pinned WhatsApp` → `Options`_.
2. If you prefer buttons over shortcuts, there is a toolbar button you can press to toggle the pinned tab.

This extension is an independent project, has no relationship, and is not affiliated to WhatsApp or Meta in any way. This extension is primarily for personal use; a personal project if you will. This add-on <i>only</i> launches their web app in the sidebar. WhatsApp™ is a registered trademark of Meta.
