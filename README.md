## Introduction

A Firefox extension to open or toggle a pinned tab with WhatsApp Web within it. This extension also adds a shortcut, and a button toggle within the toolbar.

## How to Use

1. Toggle the pinned tab by pressing _`Alt+Shift+W`_. This shortcut can be changed by going to _`Add-ons` → `WhatsApp Pinned` → `Options`_.
2. If you prefer buttons over shortcuts, there is a toolbar button you can press to toggle the pinned tab.

This add-on <i>only</i> launches their web app in the sidebar. WhatsApp™ is a registered trademark of Meta.
